    <h2>Filipino Leche Flan</h2>
    <p>My mom would always make this Filipino leche flan for dessert for me and I always loved it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Caramel:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Custard:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk </li>
        <li>12 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li> 
    <li>Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture is thickened and light brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Spread caramel evenly over the inside of a flan mold, tilting the mold to make sure the whole surface is covered.</li>
    <li>Combine evaporated milk, condensed milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Stir lightly to prevent bubbles or foam from forming. Strain batter slowly into the caramel-lined flan mold. Cover with aluminum foil. Place mold onto a baking pan filled with water.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 1 hour. Let cool, about 30 minutes. Invert carefully onto a platter.</li>
    </ol>
